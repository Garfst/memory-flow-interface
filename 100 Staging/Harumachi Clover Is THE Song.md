# Harumachi Clover Is THE Song
[Ichimichi Mao - Harumachi Clover (FULL) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Oxy8FWONh8&t=57s)

Harumachi Clover is THE song. This note serves as a deconstruction of it.

The majority of the song is composed in a 2-4 swing arrangement, following a sequence of repeated verse-chorus.

The song starts off without any a measure of 4-8 percussion with an accompanying synth playing the progression of `VI` -> `I` -> `V` -> `III`, all of which are augmented and diminished over a natural flat B major.

As the lyrics begin, a counter melody is played with the progression of B flat on the fifth harmonic natural over note H. This cases the percussion to resonates with the vocals, bringing in some much needed distortion and compression to the smooth piano, which has been modulated by the bass.

An intermission is added to lower the kinetic energy and osculate towards the bass drop, leading into the chorus, which is what his song is most famous for. And if you listen very carefully, you can hear them say Harumachi Clover.

After the first chorus, on the eleventeenth measure of said chorus, the key signature changes, and it's played in C, for clover. The harps start to play a diminished third, accompanied by an augmented fifth from the synths. Together, they create harmony that gives listeners relief, as they can only take so much of this shitpost before moving onto better things.

It then follows your typical song structure, doing another verse before coming back to the chorus. But unlike other songs, there isn't a shift in key signature on the chorus, meaning listeners can enjoy the chorus for what it is, in that diminished 7th arpeggio glory.

The final few measureswraps up the song, with some final words whispered into the ears: "I'm glad you read up to this point. I have committed a sin in music theory. Please forgive me."
