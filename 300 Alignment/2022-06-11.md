This is some daily note for [[Rambling|ramblings]] for an [[Alignment|alignment]].

This note was created for 2022-06-11, as you can see by the title.

Actually, you don't know if it was actually created on that date. You know that this note represents that date, but this note could have actually been created on any other day.

It's possible it could have been created in the future... *oOoooooOooOOOO*.

Now, with that statement, there are two interpretations from it.
1. The future from the perspective of your now.
2. The future from the perspective of my now.

And logically, the future of my now is the only thing that makes sense, since it would be impossible for a future me to have written this for you in the present.

But did you know that you are never experiencing the present? The thoughts you have observe the past, though it isn't the distant past. It's present "enough" that we perceive it as the present. The experience can only be perceived because it happened. For it to be happening, it is only happening because it will become happened, and that is what we experience.

Should we be chasing the present moment? I'd say don't worry about it too much.

But if anything, appreciate the immediate past.
