# Alignment
**Alignment** is the verification of recent thoughts and actions to see if they resonate with current ideologies. This can be thought of a routine check-in, self-therapy, self-mentorship, etc.

Alignment is also the time to freely [[Rambling|Ramble]] on things that's on your mind, though it may be better to do a guided check-in. 

These should be done on a daily basis. Perhaps first thing in the morning, last thing in the day, or both. They can also be done as-needed.

For actual usage inside of Obsidian, see [[Periodic Notes for Alignment]].

## General Process
You can think of alignment as a personal diary or journal; write down anything and everything. No one is going to see what you write. No one but you can parse your own mind. Face yourself and appreciate your ability to think.

Some things to consider asking yourself during alignment are the following.
- How do you feel about today?
- Is there anything troubling you right now?
- What are you grateful today?
- What's the next best step forward?

Don't be too forceful when doing alignments. It's more feel than process. If you don't feel like going through your set of questions for the day, then don't.

For a bigger-picture approach, see [[Answering Big Questions with Alignment]].

## Random Daily Alignment Example
In this example, italicized questions are questions raised internally based on what they just wrote. Everyone processes their thoughts differently, but it's a valuable tool to be self-aware and question ones own thoughts.
> **How do you feel about today?**
> Good.
> 
> *Why do you feel good?*
> I got free ice cream at the ice cream shop. 
> 
> *What about that feels good?* 
> It felt like they appreciated the day's efforts. 
> 
> *What about being appreciated makes you feel good?* 
> It's something about the joy of being acknowledged. Something about being heard...
> 
> *What do you mean by being heard?*
> I don't know I liked being heard... There's something about having someone listen to me and be considerate of my doings. It's comforting.
> 
> *Do you think this is something you would like to explore some more?*
>This is important for me to understand what makes me happy, because I was felt happy. I want to understand what about this makes me happy.
