# Organizing by Folders vs Tags
**Problem**: I don't know whether I should organize my notes through folders or [[Tags|tags]].

[[Personal Knowledge Management|PKM]] interfaces with a [[Personal Knowledge Database|database of notes]]. We can leverage some ideas from [Entity-Relationship Diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model#Relationships,_roles_and_cardinalities), which abstract the ideas of databases. From that, we're going to use the idea of [Cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality).

In short, any object A can relate to a certain amount of objects B. How many objects A can relate to object B *is the cardinality*. Direction matters.

> **A note can belong to zero or an infinite amount of tags.**
> Tags can belong to one or an infinite amount of notes.
> ...
> **However, a note must only belong to one folder.**
> Folders can belong to zero or an infinite amount of notes.

Tags can represent a note of multiple attributes from a common set (e.g. multiple [[Tags are Disciplines|Disciplines]]).

Folders should be leveraged when a note **must** have one attribute from a set.

## Suggestion Course of Action
It's best to think of notes as having attributes. Tags and folders are a means to give attributes to notes, but with different constraints.

Since folders will be one of the primary methods of navigating your vault, it would be wise to consider some commonly used attribute setâ€”an attribute set that all notes must have only one of, and only one.

For this vault, we are using [[Folders as Working States]].

Tags have no real constraints, but can get messy without consistency. For example, do you use the plural or singular form of a tag? If one isn't vigilant, tagging can cause redundancy. But sometimes this redundancy is needed.

Tags should be treated with careful consideration.
