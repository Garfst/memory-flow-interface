# Done (Working State)
The final step of [[Folders as Working States|Working State]] is **Done**. Notes that are no longer being [[Working (Working State)|Worked]] on or are done with review/revisions at [[Staging (Working State)|Staged]] go here.

An alternative for notes that aren't up to par, or have been abandoned, might be considered [[Stale (Working State)|Stale]].

For this vault, the `📁 200 Resources` represents done.
