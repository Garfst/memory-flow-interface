# Stale (Working State)
**Stale** is a [[Folders as Working States|Working State]] for information containers (notes) that aren't being touched anymore. These notes aren't useful enough to be directly linked or reference, but still hold historical information that could potentially be useful in the future, given some more work and relevancy.

Notes that are useful for reference could instead be considered [[Done (Working State)|Done]].

For this vault, the `📁 900 Archive` represents stale.
