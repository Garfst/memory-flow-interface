# Tags
Notes can be thought of as having certain attributes. **Tags** explicitly give attributes to notes, which can then be used to reference and organize said notes.

#fundamental â‡½ This is a tag. This note now tagged as "fundamental".

Some Obsidian plugins leverage tags for more than just categorizing notes, like [[Tasks]], which uses tags to mark checklist items as a Task for later reference.

## Naming Tags
One may consider naming tags based on [[Tags are Disciplines|Disciplines]]. As for what disciplines, you can derive it based on what notes you have (or plan to have). For example, a note about ceramics may give birth to `#cermaics`, but can also birth `#art`. 

Tags may also come to existence based on structure or intent of notes. For example, `#definition` might be used to denote a note that describes a concept. Then `#connection` can be used to flesh out connections between two ideas.

## Referencing
Using tags, we can run search queries to reference and organize notes with tags. This is how one can *organize* their notes.

Let's find all the notes that are considered *fundamental*, but are more so suggestions.

**Raw Query**
> \`\`\`query
> tag:#fundamental tag:#suggestion
> \`\`\`

**Running Query**
```query
tag:#fundamental tag:#suggestion
```

You can also just use the search function on the left sidebar.
