# Practical Workflow of MFI
You are your own producer and manager of your thoughts. When externalizing thoughts on MFI, the key is to reduce complexity so you can focus on the real work, rather than management. Get the best results with minimal effort.

To understand workflow, one should be familiar with [[Folders as Working States|Working States]]. In short, ideas start out as "being worked on", and eventually progress towards "done" (or at least *good enough*).

## Generalized Process
You have ideas you wish to expand within MFI.
1. In your information container, fully capture the idea. This idea is now being considered being in the state of [[Working (Working State)|Working]].
	- It's suggested to take a break afterwards to let your own brain process and refresh your mindset.
2. Idea is further processed and iterated on, linking other relevant ideas.
	- Usually this would be done in the form of [[Rambling|Rambling]].
3. Conclusions are drawn. The idea is moved to long-term storage and is now considered [[Done (Working State)|Done]].
4. Educated actions are taken as a result of new knowledge.

This process is a positive feedback loop—from the conclusion, more ideas are formed and are open for exploration.

## Working with Obsidian (Example)
Working states are represented with [[Folders as Working States|Folders]]. Working states progress as follows.
> [[Working (Working State)|Working]] ⇾ [[Staging (Working State)|Staging]] ⇾ [[Done (Working State)|Done]]/[[Stale (Working State)|Stale]]

You want to take notes on [Non-linear Gameplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_gameplay).
1. You create a new note named `Non-linear Gameplay` under `📁 000 Inbox`. The note is now considered [[Working (Working State)|Working]]
2. You fully write down your interpretations of the article.
3. Once done, the note is moved to `📁 100 Staging` and is considered [[Staging (Working State)|Staging]].
4. You review said note and simplify concepts, linking some other related notes.
5. You evaluate the note looks good enough and draw conclusions. The note is moved to `📁 200 Resources` and is now considered [[Done (Working State)|Done]].
	- Alternatively, it's moved to `📁 900 Archive` if the note is [[Stale (Working State)|Stale]] and has been abandoned.
6. You apply that new-found knowledge to developing non-linear experiences.

This now raises more questions, asking what linear gameplay is and how it compares to non-linear. You start to do research on linear gameplay to compare the two, and the process keeps iterating on itself.

> If you want to take a break during the workflow, you come back and see whatever unfinished work you have under `📁 100 Staging` or `📁 000 Inbox`. Optionally, you could leverage [[Tasks|Tasks]].
