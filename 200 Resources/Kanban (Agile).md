# Kanban (Agile)
**Kanban** is an adaptation of [[Agile Project Management]] and is a workflow that uses a visual aid of columns to help organize work and increase its efficiency. It can also bring to light "invisible work" that has not been accounted for. 

It should be applied directly to how you currently work, not the other way around.

Kanban is a pull system. If you have free hands, you can pull a task to work on it.

## Example
| Backlog         | Working  | Done         |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Shop for dinner | Exercise | Brush Teeth  |
|                 |          | Water Garden |
|                 |          | Do Homework  |

The very left **Backlog** can be thought of a backlog for [[Scrum (Agile)|Scrum]]. Cards move from left to right as working states progresses. These cards should require a small amount of work that one can finish it within a reasonable time-frame (e.g. less than 2 hours).

Another popular adaptation of Agile is [[Scrum (Agile)|Scrum]].
