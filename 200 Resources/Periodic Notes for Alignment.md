# Periodic Notes for Alignment
Obsidian has a plugin called [Periodic Notes](obsidian://show-plugin?id=periodic-notes) and [Calendar](obsidian://show-plugin?id=calendar). They allow for quick access and the creation of notes for the daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly occasions.

These plugins are already installed and enabled on this vault. On the right sidebar, top panel, second tab, is the calendar. If you click on a date, you can bring up a note that corresponds to that date. This is where you can visually see your daily and weekly alignment.

For monthly, quarterly, and yearly notes, you'll have to use the command palette `Ctrl + P`.

You can also bring up today's daily alignment note by pressing `Ctrl + T`.
