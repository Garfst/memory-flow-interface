# Tags are Disciplines
**Problem**: In [Life Disciplines Projects (LDP)](https://github.com/uwidev/life-disciplines-projects), Disciplines had a dedicated folder, which was separate from the [[Folders as Working States|Inbox folder]]. This meant that when creating a new note, it could either go into Inbox or under a related Discipline(s). Where this note was to go wasn't clear, created redundancy, and made things messy.

Disciplines now exist within the realm of [[Tags|Tags]].  If you think about it, any tag can be a discipline with enough effort.

The Disciplines folder no longer exist, and all incoming [[Working (Working State)|Working]] notes now go to `üìÅ 000 Inbox`.

The Disciplines folder was originally meant as a place to categorize a note to said discipline, but we could easily do that through tags. Having it as tags would also allow a note to be a part of multiple disciplines, rather than locked to a single discipline, [[Organizing by Folders vs Tags|further elaborated here]].

If you need a discipline elaborated on, you can always create a note that specifically defines that discipline, or have a note that functions as a glossary of tags. Though with the former, it may also function as a **Mapping of Content**, or as a [[Dashboard|Dashboard]] to hold or query [[Tasks|Tasks]], or as locations for [[Rambling|Ramblings]], or as an [evergreen note](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes).
