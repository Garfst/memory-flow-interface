# Working (Working State)
**Working** is a [[Folders as Working States|Working State]] and is the initial state of information containers (notes). This is when information is being inputted into the system. Some may also consider when information is being modified to also be working.

Some people like to differentiate the initial input and review/revisions. An intermediate step [[Staging (Working State)|Staging]] would resolve this. More working states may be needed depending on your process.

When a note is *done*, it's usually considered in [[Done (Working State)|Done]] or [[Stale (Working State)|Stale]].

For this vault, the `üìÅ 000 Inbox` represents working.
