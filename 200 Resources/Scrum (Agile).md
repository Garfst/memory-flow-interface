# Scrum (Agile)
**Scrum** is one of many methodologies derived from [[Agile Project Management|Agile]]. Teams are encouraged to self-organize and work in increments, eventually learning through experiences. They are to routinely reflect on work and improve workflow.

Work that is generated and organized for Scrum can be described as daily work, the bigger picture, and the vision.

Another popular iteration of Scrum is [[Kanban (Agile)]].
