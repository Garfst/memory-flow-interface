# Projects
**Problem:** I need a way to organize some bigger ideas that require multiple notes, and I don't really want it to overlap already existing work.

Projects are containers containing containers of information.

You should consider using projects when dealing with complex, big goals that require [[Open-Ended Problem-Solving]]. You can also use it as a means of gathering information from a long course or a book.

## Specific to Obsidian
In Obsidian, projects can be thought of as folders containing notes, or a note that links various other notes. However, the former has an issue of not being able to separate the project files from regular notes when using [[Folders as Working States]], which this vault uses.

Projects also have their own working states. This means that upon creation, they would exist within the folder of [[Working (Working State)]], and eventually be moved to appropriate folders for [[Done (Working State)]].

When projects are done, before moving them to your root `Done` folder (or `Stale`) it's suggested to move its internal *`Done`* notes to the vault's root `Done`. Not necessary, but keeps things consistent!

> It's suggested to have a **Home Note** for the project to hold project details. If using folders, It should be placed within the project, named exactly the same as the project folder, but prepended with *00* to push it to the top. In there, you can centralize all of your [[Tasks]] and [[Rambling|Ramblings]]. You can think of this as an [Evergreen note](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) is so desired.

Projects should have their own internal Working and Done folders, among others depending on your workflow. This is to preserve the note's own working status within the project, and maintains the working status of the project itself.
