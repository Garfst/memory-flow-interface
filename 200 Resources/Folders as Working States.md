# Folders as Working States
**Problem**: I'm not too sure how I should organize my vault.
**Preface**: [[Organizing by Folders vs Tags]]

Folders be used to denote the working state of a note. Working state just defines the step in production a note is in.

In a [[Personal Knowledge Management|Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)]], usually the workflow has notes that are either in a state of `Working` or `Done`.  We can use folders to represent these states. This also serves as a means to quickly assess your current workload; on file navigation, the unfinished work is immediately visible.

So as you work, a note would progress working states as follows.
> [[Working (Working State)|Working]] -> [[Staging (Working State)|Done]]

Though some people prefer a more nuanced approach. This has the following workflow.
> [[Working (Working State)|Working]] -> [[Staging (Working State)|Staging]] -> [[Done (Working State)|Done]]/[[Stale (Working State)|Stale]]

This vault uses the following to represent above.
> `📁 000 Inbox` -> `📁 100 Staging` -> `📁 200 Resources`/`📁 900 Archive`
> >Note how these folders are prefixed so that they are pushed to the top when sorted.

Workflow for MFI is further elaborated on [[Practical Workflow of MFI]].

Having folders as working state does NOT deny the ability of using folders to organize other content. If you need a folder to hold globally useful content (e.g. `Templates`), you can still have them.

> You can prefix these globally useful folders with a high number so they get shoved at the bottom (e.g. 999), or not prefix them at all. For the latter, they'll still be shoved to the bottom since letters come after numbers.

If categories for sorting are absolutely necessary, having folders within the `Done` folder would work.
