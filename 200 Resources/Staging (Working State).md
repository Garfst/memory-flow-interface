# Staging (Working State)
**Staging** is [[Folders as Working States|Working State]], and is the intermediate step between [[Working (Working State)|Working]] and [[Done (Working State)|Done]]/[[Stale (Working State)|Stale]], which is review/revision. It's a step for those who wish to differentiate between the initial brainstorm and review/revision.

For this vault, the `📁 100 Staging` represents staging.
