# Personal Knowledge Management
**Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)** is the aggregation and iteration of one's knowledge to draw conclusions, develop new concepts, or achieve a goal. 

The simple act of taking notes and organizing during a classroom lecture can be thought as a form of PKM.

A PKM is most commonly referred to as a second brain, and modeling a PKM system after the brain intuitively works the best. These systems typically work as follows.
1. Input is given into the system.
2. The input is processed, revised, re-organized, etc.
3. Conclusions are drawn and a call to action is performed; input is stored for long-term use.

Applying this workflow ideology to Obsidian and MFI, consider seeing [[Practical Workflow of MFI]].

PKM usually works off of some [[Personal Knowledge Database|Personal Knowledge Database (PKD)]].
