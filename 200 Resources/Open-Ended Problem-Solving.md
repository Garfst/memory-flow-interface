# Open-Ended Problem-Solving
**Open-Ended Problem-Solving** is the act of resolving goals within an environment of a vague sense of direction or unclear tool-set. One can think of this as trying to figure out how to have fun in a sandbox.

This kind of problem-solving is usually seen as difficult, since people have to reach into a void of mostly nothingness, and pull out some seemingly random solution that may or may not work. This can lead to decision paralysis as it can be perceived as infinite solutions, or possibly no solutions at all.

## Practical Example of Open-Ended Problem-Solving
> Let's say you have a goal of getting fit, but you can't just *get fit*. This is an open-ended problem. There are no trains to jump on that give you the solution.
> 
> You could run a mile every day, but, what does being fit even mean to you?
> 
> Perhaps let's do a baseline reference. What do other people (google) consider being fit?
> 
> Do you think that's reasonable for you? What's your own sense of being fit?
> 
> And now that you have that idea, what will you actually do to get there? Exercises? Okay, now what exercise? How many reps? How many sets? Do you go until failure? What is failure?
> 
> I just want to feel fit. Well, what does that feel like? Let's try things out and see how I feel. Then we can work from there.
