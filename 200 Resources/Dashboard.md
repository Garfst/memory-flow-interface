# Dashboard
**Dashboards** gather information and display it in a highly digestible manner. This is especially useful when the raw information is vast and complex (e.g. having a lot of notes).

In the context of [[Personal Knowledge Management|Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)]] within Obsidian, dashboards are just like any regular note. They can be used to hold definitions (of [[Tags|Tags]]), act as entry links to the rest of your notes, or gather [[Tasks|Tasks]], among many other things.

Dashboards are case-specific and can be very personal. So long as it delivers information, and is can be comprehended in a timely manner, and is actionable—it's good enough.

## Some Applications of Dashboards
A common dashboard is a *Home* dashboard, with a popular component being a way to see today's work.

If you use checklists, you can turn them into tasks and aggregate them with queries through the [Tasks](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-tasks-plugin) plugin, which is already installed and enabled on this vault. 

You can also query for files under `📁 000 Inbox` or  `📁 100 Staging`, though this is redundant with [[Folders as Working States]].

A quick trick to resume and jump to an unfinished point of a note is to have a tag specifically for this purpose, say `#resume`. Now, if you query for a `#resume` tag, Obsidian will immediately jump to the note, and scroll down to where the tag is.

See [[01 🏠 Main Dashboard|🏠 Main Dashboard]] or [[02 🎨 Arts Dashboard|🎨 Arts Dashboard]] for an example.
