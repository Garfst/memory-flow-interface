# Answering Big Questions with Alignment
[[Alignment|Allignment]] can be done on a daily basis, but you may want to consider special alignments for weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly alignments.

During these special alignments, you may want to ask bigger questions of life and reflect on a wider time frame. Something everyone should consider doing at least once a year, if not once, is to do alignment on their current life situation, discussing and reviewing why they exist, etc.

Some important questions to consider answering are the following.
- What are one's core values when it comes to a subjective *good* life? 
- Does their current circumstances allow for that life to happen? 
- What steps can be taken to progress towards that kind of life? 
- What kind of person do you want to be, and who are you right now?
- How have you changed since the last time you did something like this? Is it a good change?
- Are you happy with how things are?
