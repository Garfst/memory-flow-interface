# Rambling
Given some topic of interest, **Rambling** is the inconsequential dialogue and mind-wandering that may result in meaningful results.

Mentally processing content is the work that is invisible to everyone and everything. Rambling acts as an interface to guide this mental processing, and how realizations are made.

In the context of [[Personal Knowledge Management|Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)]], the environment is very [[Open-Ended Problem-Solving|open-ended]]. You start out with abstract ideas in need of resolution. Rambling is a tool to resolve those ideas, and if anything, tells you what works and what doesn't.

[[Projects|Projects]] can benefit from rambling, as it can help flesh out its true purpose and intentions. It will also help with understanding if work actually benefits the project. Rambling does wonders for processing personal thoughts and improving mental health; see [[Alignment]].

## General Process
What's important isn't the materialistic yields, but the internal neural connections built by going through the processâ€”a good note is just the kicker. There is no right or wrong way to ramble, though you should have some focused direction.

Given a topic of interest, write your thoughts. Keep asking why and answer those whys, creating a curious positive-feedback look.

If your ramble ever comes to fruition, you can factor out the rambling into its own note with an appropriate title if needed.

## Random Example of Rambling
Topic of Interest: What makes water so important?
> Well, we need water to survive, right? But that's just us humans. It's not just humans that need water, literally every living thing requires water. I don't think there's any living thing that does not require any amount of water to survive, and if so, that's crazy.

> But it isn't just living things, the environment also needs, well, may not need, but they function with water. Beaches are made because of water, and other environments are created by the erosion of water.

> Water also serves the purpose of cooling down the Earth too, right? Well, doesn't it also warm up the earth too? I would probably have to verify that, but it does serve double duty in maintaining temperatures.
