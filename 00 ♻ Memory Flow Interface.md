# Everything About Memory Flow Interface
Memory Flow Interface (MFI) is a working environment that promotes the externalization of working memory for mental processing.

MFI is a form of [[Personal Knowledge Management|Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)]], and can be thought of as creating a second brain optimized for processing ideas, with secondary goals being long-term storage, information retrieval, and mental health.

This vault is an integration of MFI with Obsidian, and has been catered towards personal life-management rather than managing teams or corporate, but concepts discussed here can be applied there too.

## Audience
MFI is a PKM, a workflow, a task/project management framework, a journal, a form of meditation, and a creative outlet.

But most importantly, MFI is for people who want a better understanding of how their mind works. It encourages a lot of rambling as a means of self-actuation, to discover patterns of thought and raise self-awareness. And it's through these ramblings where revelations occur, such as the inability to start work due to fear of incompetence and decision paralysis.

MFI is designed to be powerfully basic. The core elements allow for immense personal development and information management. If so desired, users can bring in other [[#Further Reading|tools and other concepts]] to create a more nuanced environment that suits their needs.

## Context
Our working memory and ability to internally process information is rather limited. [It's been observed that seven (plus or minus two) chunks of information is what most people can work with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two). Anymore and information is either lost, workflow is hindered, or both.

One of the best ways to help us get around that limit and enhance processing is having a means to externalize our working memory. The internal memory gets off-loaded and now existing as a memory of the environment. This externalized memory can now flow to and out of our internal working memory and store any manipulations apply onto it.

Language is one of the most common forms of externalizing working memory, and for MFI in Obsidian, it's mostly about writing. From writing, we get notes. And from notes, we get databases and PKM. MFI serves to help create that practical space for externalizing working memory.

## Fundamental Concepts
- You need a container (or workspace) to represent and hold your ideas.
- The container for your ideas should have a focus, and always has a working state of *being worked on* or *done*.
- The generalized [[Practical Workflow of MFI|Workflow]] is as follows: Input, Process, Conclude, Act.
- [[Rambling|Rambling]] is used to drive mental processing and link relevant ideas.
- Frequent check-ins as a form of self-reflection are done through life-rambling. 
	- This promotes fair mental state and well-being, and is important for processing information well.
- Reminders, checklists, and inline *notes about your notes* are used to quickly load external working memory back into internal working memory. 
	- This is important, since mental fatigue is unfortunately (or fortunately) a thing, and you will walk away from the MFI for a break.
	- This also allows you to internally process the information during cycles of sleep.

## Applied to Obsidian
- The container for ideas is a note, but [[Projects|the container can also be a Project]], which is a container (folders) for containers (notes).
- [[Organizing by Folders vs Tags|Folders are used to denote the working state of a note]]. This is because a note must be in one, and only one, folder (ignoring root). Whatever folder the note is in denotes that note's working state.
	- Projects have their own internal working state folders.
- [[Tasks|Checklists as Tasks]] with the [Tasks Plugin](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-tasks-plugin) serve the purpose of reminders.
- Check-ins are done daily or as needed as [[Alignment|Alignments]]. [[Periodic Notes for Alignment|They utilize a few plugins for ease of use]].

## Useful Concepts and Tools
- Notes can be organized by [[Tags|Tags]], which denote its characteristics or relation to [[Tags are Disciplines|Disciplines]]. This is used for organizing and retrieving notes.
- Tasks, metadata, and other information can be aggregated and put onto [[Dashboard|Dashboard]] to efficiently load information back onto working memory.
- [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) can also be used to represent projects.

## Shortcomings
MFI requires the externalization of thoughts. That which cannot be externalized cannot be consumed and processed. This means that extremely early ideas or abstract concepts may not be able to utilize MFI, since describing them may not even be possible. Since Obsidian is mostly text-based, any pictures, videos, etc. are questionable.

Messy notes will break MFI. Since MFI relies on your ability to externalize information, that then needs to re-consume into your working memory to process. You can't consume messy notes. You can get around this by providing context (or just writing better notes).

MFI is not a substitute for experience. You can't externalize a skill, neither can you consume a skill. You can externalize the theory and consume the theory, but all that's learned is how it's supposed to be done. Practical experience is something MFI will never be able to achieve unless we start directly wiring our brains. *Though, you do experience and learn the act of externalizing and processing your thoughts.*

MFI also requires that you have access to said environment. Since this is integrated within Obsidian, if you don't have access to your vault, either through a computer or mobile device, you can't use it. As a workaround, so long as you understand the fundamental concepts, you should be able to use pen and paper.

## Further Reading
Not required, but can be useful in understanding how LDP was derived. You could also implement these ideas into your own workflow.
- [[Getting Things Done]] is a task management framework, having a 5-step process of information capturing, processing, organizing, review, and engagement.
- [[Pillars, Pipelines, Vaults (PPV)]] leverages systems thinking to develop focus, alignment, and knowledge.
- [[Agile Project Management|Agile]] is a set of project management principles for speedy turnover, focusing on people, products, and tools.
- [[Scrum (Agile)|Scrum]] is a derivative of Agile, and looks to describe the day's work and how it relates to the bigger picture.
- [[Kanban (Agile)|Kanban]] is another derivative of Agile, and is a task management workflow that leverages some visual board to bucket the working status of a task.
- [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) are accumulated insights of a particular concept; these notes grow across projects and serve as definitions
